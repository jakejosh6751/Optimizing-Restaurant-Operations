# Optimizing-Restaurant-Operations:
## Analyzing Order Patterns to Enhance Efficiency and Boost Sales

### Project Overview
This project carefully examines restaurant order data to identify key trends and insights. Through comprehensive exploratory data analysis, we uncover the slow and fast periods to optimize kitchen operations and improve preparation times. Additionally, we identify the most profitable and frequently ordered menu items, providing a clear picture of customer preferences. The highlight of this analysis is determining which categories of international cuisines should be added to the menu based on current performance, aiming to enhance customer satisfaction and drive sales.

The data set used in this analysis from "Maven Analytics" has two tables with a quarter's worth of orders from a fictitious restaurant serving international cuisine, including the date and time of each order, the items ordered, and additional details on the type, name and price of the items.
